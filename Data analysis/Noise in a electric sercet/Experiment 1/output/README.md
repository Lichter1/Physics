# Output Files Organization

This folder contains all the analysis outputs generated by `noise_filter_analysis.py`.

## Folder Structure

```
output/
├── filtered_plots/       # Main analysis plots with filtering visualization
├── distribution_plots/   # Statistical distribution histograms
└── results/             # Text-based analysis results
```

## Contents

### filtered_plots/
Contains the main white noise filtering plots for each resistor:
- Shows accepted (green) and rejected (red) data points
- Includes an inset zoom view of a representative frequency region
- Dashed rectangle indicates the zoomed region
- Files: `filtered_[resistance].png`

### distribution_plots/
Contains statistical distribution analysis for each resistor:
- Histogram of accepted white noise values
- Gaussian fit overlay
- Mean and standard deviation markers (±1σ, ±2σ)
- Shapiro-Wilk normality test results
- Files: `distribution_[resistance].png`

### results/
Contains text summaries of the analysis:
- `noise_analysis_results.txt` - Summary table of all resistor measurements

## How to Generate

Run the analysis script:
```bash
# Single resistor (913 ohm)
python3 noise_filter_analysis.py

# All resistors
python3 noise_filter_analysis.py --all
```

All outputs will be automatically saved to the appropriate folders.
